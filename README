HiPR - High-throughput Probabilistic inference of RNA secondary structures 

Estimate secondary structure and base pairing posteriors for a given RNA sequence based on the distribution of read fragments along the locus.

This program requires a file containing the sequence and initial secondary structure of an RNA of interest, a file containing DMS-seq reads along the locus, and a file containing the initial estimates of per-nucleotide modification rates. A Bayesian MCMC algorithm is then used to estimate the base pairing posterior that best fits the observed sequencing reads. The results and intermediate files are written to a directory (HiPR_output/ by default).

The output file HiPR_posterior.txt contains the base pairing posteriors at each nucleotide position, one entry per line.

The output file HiPR_structure.txt contains the consensus secondary structure.
