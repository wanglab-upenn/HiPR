NAME
       HiPR - Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference of RNA secondary
       structures.

SYNOPSIS
       HiPR [options] reads_file rates_file structure_file

ARGUMENTS
       reads_file
               File containing either DMS-seq or dsRNA/ssNRA-seq reads.

       rates_file
               File containing enzyme digestion rates. The first line should
               contain four comma-delimited rates corresponding to digestion
               probabilities 3' of paired [A,C,U,G] nucleotides.  The second
               line should contain rates 3' of unpaired [A,C,U,G] positions.

       structure_file
               File containing the sequence and structure of the RNA of
               interest. The provided dot-paren structure is used as the
               initial estimate.

OPTIONS
       -rmin INT
               Minimum read length. Fragments shorter than this will not be
               included in likelihood calcuations. Defaults to 40.

       -rmax INT
               Maximum read length. Fragments longer than this will not be
               included in likelihood calcuations. Defaults to 80.

       -n INT  Number of MCMC iterations to run. Defaults to 100000.

       -numCPU INT
               Maximum number of CPUs to use. Defaults to 1.

       -burn_in INT
               Number of MCMC iterations to discard as burn-in when computing
               posterior. Defaults to 10000.

       -samp INT
               Sampling frequency of MCMC iterations after burn-in. Defaults
               to 100.

       -t [sd] Selects which parameter to optimize. 's' indicates structure
               and 'd' indicates digestion rates. Defaults to 's' for
               structure estimation.

       -m INT  Select likelihood model to use (1=dsRNA/ssRNA-seq, 2=DMS-seq)

       -mc DOUBLE
               Proportionality constant used in Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
               criterion (Default = 999.0)

       -likelihood_only
               Only compute the initial log-likelihood (do not perform MCMC
               iterations)

       -outdir dir
               Directory to output results. Defaults to 'HiPR_output/'.

       -help   Print a brief help message and exits.

       -man    Prints the manual page and exits.

DESCRIPTION
       Estimate secondary structure and base pairing posteriors for a given
       RNA sequence based on the distribution of read fragments along the
       locus.

       This program requires a file containing the sequence and initial
       secondary structure of an RNA of interest, a file containing DMS-seq or
       dsRNA-seq/ssRNA-seq reads, and a file containing the initial estimates
       of per-nucleotide modification rates. A Bayesian MCMC algorithm is then
       used to estimate the base pairing posterior that best fits the observed
       sequencing reads. The results and intermediate files are written to a
       directory (HiPR_output/ by default).

       The output file posterior.txt contains the base pairing posteriors at
       each nucleotide position, one entry per line.

       The output file structure.txt contains the consensus secondary
       structure.
