       Mandatory arguments (need to be specified before optional arguments)
          reads_file -- File containing DMS-seq reads for RNA locus of interest (collapsed read format)
          rates_file -- File containing the initial estimates of per-nucleotide modification rates
          structure_file -- File containing the sequence and initial secondary structure of an RNA of interest

       Recognized optional command line arguments (need to be specified after mandatory arguments)
          -outDir <string>  -- Set name of output folder (default=HiPR_output)
          -locusName <string>  -- Set name of locus (default=UnnamedLocus)
          -n <integer> -- Set maximum number of MCMC iterations (default=100000)
          -numCPU <integer> -- Set number of CPUs to use (default=16)
          -rmin <integer> -- Set mininum read length (default=15)
          -rmax <integer> -- Set maximum read length (defauld=40)

DESCRIPTION
    Estimate secondary structure and base pairing posteriors for a given RNA
    sequence based on the distribution of read fragments along the locus.

    This program requires a file containing the sequence and initial
    secondary structure of an RNA of interest, a file containing DMS-seq
    reads, and a file containing the initial estimates of per-nucleotide
    modification rates. A Bayesian MCMC algorithm is then used to estimate
    the base pairing posterior that best fits the observed sequencing reads.
    The results and intermediate files are written to a directory
    (HiPR_output/ by default).

    The output file HiPR_posterior.txt contains the base pairing posteriors
    at each nucleotide position, one entry per line.

    The output file HiPR_structure.txt contains the consensus secondary
    structure.

  Requirements
    Mandatory files must be specified before any other optional arguments
    and must exist, otherwise a error or usage message will be shown.
